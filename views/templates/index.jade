      h3 Dear Residents of Southfield,
      br
      h3.inline I believe the citizens of Southfield deserve a modern government,
      h3.inline which is transparent, accesible, and flexible enough to adopt to the needs of a changing world.
      h3.inline Over the past fifteen years, I have served on City Council, the Library Board and the Planning Commission.
      h3.inline I wish to continue this service by returning to the City Council. 
      h3.inline To do this, I need your support by voting for me on November 7th.
      br
      h3.inline My candidacy is based on three values:
      ol
        li
          h3.bullet The City of Southfield needs to provide transparency and accessibility through technology
        li
          h3.bullet We must build a sustainable Southfield by preparing for our future today
        li
          h3.bullet Our police, fire, and city workers deserve competitive salaries and modern equipment to protect this city
      h3.inline These values will lead to a sustainable Southfield that works for all of us.
      h3.inline I hope to earn your support on November 8th.
      br
      h2.inline - Linnie Taylor
